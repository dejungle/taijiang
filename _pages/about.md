I am an assistant researcher of the [Graphics and Geometric Computing Group](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I am also with [BNRist](http://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I received my bachelor's degree and Ph.D., mentored by [Prof. Shi-Min Hu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/shimin.htm), in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University in 2011 and 2016, respectively. My research is in Computer Graphics and I am currently intrested in visual media (i.e., image, video, 3D, etc.) understanding with deep learning and their applications on Robotic.
